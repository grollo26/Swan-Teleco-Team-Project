# Customer Retention Analysis and Churn Prediction

Welcome to the **Customer Retention Analysis and Churn Prediction** project! This repository contains all the resources and information necessary to understand the factors contributing to customer churn and strategies to enhance retention. Additionally, it provides a list of customers who are most likely to churn, along with their probabilities, to help focus retention efforts.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an interactive info deck in Tableau that offers insights into customer churn patterns, reasons for churn, and recommendations to improve retention. The key components of the project include:

- **Info Deck**: An interactive Tableau dashboard that presents comprehensive information on churners, their demographics, and service usage, and provides actionable insights for improving customer retention.
- **Churn Analysis**: Detailed analysis of why customers churn and which factors are most influential.
- **Churn Prediction**: A list of the 500 customers most likely to churn, along with their predicted probabilities of churning.

You can explore the Tableau info deck directly using the following link: [Customer Retention Info Deck](https://public.tableau.com/views/swan_customer_retention_info_deck/Story1?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Repository Structure

- `/data`: Contains the datasets used for analysis and modeling.
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- `/reports`: Documents and reports detailing the findings, recommendations, and analysis results.
- `/tableau`: Tableau workbook files and links to the public dashboard.

## Key Findings

- **Demographics of Churners**: The Tableau dashboard provides insights into the demographics of churners, including age, gender, and family composition.
- **Reasons for Churn**: Analysis reveals key reasons for churn, such as dissatisfaction with service quality, better offers from competitors, and the nature of the contracts.
- **Retention Strategies**: Recommendations include enhancing service quality, offering competitive speeds and prices, and incentivizing longer-term contracts.

## How to Use the Info Deck

1. **Explore the Dashboard**:
   Use the filters and charts in the Tableau dashboard to interactively explore the data and gain insights into different customer segments.

2. **Analyze Churn Patterns**:
   Examine the reasons for churn and the demographics of churners to understand key factors contributing to customer attrition.
